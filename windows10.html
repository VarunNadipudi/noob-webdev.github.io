    <p>Windows 10 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. It is the successor to Windows 8.1, 
        which was released nearly two years earlier, and itself was released to manufacturing on July 15, 2015, and broadly released 
        for the general public on July 29, 2015.[18] Windows 10 was made available for download via MSDN and TechNet, as a free upgrade 
        for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via the Windows Store, and to Windows 7 users via Windows Update. Windows 10 
        receives new builds on an ongoing basis, which are available at no additional cost to users, in addition to additional test builds 
        of Windows 10, which are available to Windows Insiders. Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower 
        pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their ten-year lifespan
        of extended support
    </p>
    <p>Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented 
        interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, although Windows 10's 
        touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of its predecessor. 
        Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, as well as the 
        functionality and capabilities of the Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. 
        However, media outlets have been critical of the changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, 
        privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and adware-esque tactics used to promote 
        the operating system on its release.
    </p>

    <p>Microsoft initially aimed to have Windows 10 installed on over one billion devices within three years of its release; that goal was 
        ultimately reached almost five years after release on March 16, 2020. By January 2018, Windows 10 surpassed Windows 7 as the 
        most popular version of Windows worldwide. As of June 2021, it is estimated that 79% of Windows PCs, 58% of all PCs 
        (the rest being older Windows versions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux), and 24% of all devices (including 
        mobile, tablet and console) are running Windows 10. On June 24, 2021, Microsoft announced Windows 10's successor, Windows 11, 
        which was released on October 5, 2021.

        At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single software ecosystem for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices: "We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets‍—‌they'll all come together."

        In December 2013, technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed "Threshold", after a planet in its Halo franchise.[28] Similarly to "Blue" (which became Windows 8.1),[29] Foley described Threshold, not as a single operating system, but as a "wave of operating systems" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, quoting Microsoft sources, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015. She also stated that one of the goals for Threshold was to create a unified application platform and development toolkit for Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox One (which all use a similar Windows NT kernel, that at release was Windows 10's only kernel; it already claimed a hybrid kernel model, before addition of the Linux kernel in a subsequent Windows 10 update, which is otherwise a monolithic kernel).

        At the Build Conference in April 2014, Microsoft's Terry Myerson unveiled an updated version of Windows 8.1 (build 9697) that added the ability to run Windows Store apps inside desktop windows and a more traditional Start menu in place of the Start screen seen in Windows 8. The new Start menu takes after Windows 7's design by using only a portion of the screen and including a Windows 7-style application listing in the first column. The second column displays Windows 8-style app tiles. Myerson said that these changes would occur in a future update, but did not elaborate.[31][32] Microsoft also unveiled the concept of a "universal Windows app", allowing Windows Store apps created for Windows 8.1 to be ported to Windows Phone 8.1 and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase, with an interface designed for different device form factors, and allowing user data and licenses for an app to be shared between multiple platforms. Windows Phone 8.1 would share nearly 90% of the common Windows Runtime APIs with Windows 8.1 on PCs
