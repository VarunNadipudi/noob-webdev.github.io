    <p>Windows 11 is a major version of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft that was announced on June 24,2021, 
        and is the successor to Windows 10, which was released in 2015. Windows 11 was released to the public on October 5, 2021, 
        as a free upgrade via Windows Update and Windows 11 Installation Assistant on eligible devices running Windows 10.
    </p>

    <p>Windows 11 features major changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows 10X, including a redesigned Start menu,
        the replacement of its "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets" panel on the taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows 
        that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group, Microsoft Teams being integrated into the taskbar, and new gaming 
        technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer
        (IE) has been replaced by the Blink engine-based Microsoft Edge, while IE's core is retained for Edge's IE mode,[11] and Microsoft
        Teams is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be 
        distributed via Microsoft Store.
    </p>

    <p>Microsoft increased the hardware requirements compared to Windows 10, with Microsoft only supporting the operating system with updates
        on devices using an eighth-generation Intel Core CPU or newer (with some exceptions), AMD Ryzen CPU based on Zen+ microarchitecture 
        or newer, or Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 ARM system-on-chip or newer. Windows 11 is built for UEFI secure boot and Trusted Platform 
        Module (TPM) 2.0 support. Additionally, Windows 11 no longer supports 32-bit x86 architecture or systems using BIOS firmware.
    </p>

    <p>Windows 11 has received a mixed to positive reception; pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware 
        requirements, with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or a ploy to upsell 
        users to newer devices, and over e-waste associated with the changes. Upon its release, Windows 11 received positive reviews for its 
        improved visual design, window management, and stronger focus on security, but was panned for regressions and modifications to 
        aspects of its user interface.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size:45px; background-color:aliceblue; color:blue; text-align:center">Development</h3>
    <p>At the 2015 Ignite conference, Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that Windows 10 would be the "last version of Windows", a statement 
        that Microsoft confirmed was "reflective" of its view.[12][13] The operating system was considered to be a service, with new builds 
        and updates to be released over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In October 2019, Microsoft announced "Windows 10X", a future edition of Windows 10 designed exclusively for dual-touchscreen devices 
        such as the then-upcoming Surface Neo. It featured a modified user interface designed around context-sensitive "postures" for different 
        screen configurations and usage scenarios, and changes such as a centered taskbar and updated Start menu without Windows 10's 
        "live tiles". Legacy Windows applications would also be required to run in "containers" to ensure performance and power optimization. 
        Microsoft stated that it planned to release Windows 10X devices by the end of 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
        In May 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, chief product officer for Microsoft Windows and Office Panos Panay stated that "as we continue 
        to put customers’ needs at the forefront, we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now", and therefore announced that 
        Windows 10X would only launch on single-screen devices at first, and that Microsoft would "continue to look for the right moment, 
        in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market".
    </p>

    <p>
        In January 2021, it was reported that a job listing referring to a "sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows" had been posted by 
        Microsoft.[20] A visual refresh for Windows, developed under the codename "Sun Valley", was reportedly set to re-design the system's 
        user interface.[21] Microsoft began to implement and announce some of these visual changes and other new features on Windows 10 insider 
        builds, such as new system icons (which also included the replacement of shell resources dating back as far as Windows 95),[22] 
        improvements to Task View to allow changing the wallpaper on each virtual desktop, and adding the Auto HDR feature from Xbox Series X.
    </p>

    <p>
        On May 18, 2021, Head of Windows Servicing and Delivery John Cable stated that Windows 10X had been canceled, and that Microsoft would 
        be "accelerating the integration of key foundational 10X technology into other parts of Windows and products at the company".
    </p>


    <h3 style="font-size:45px; background-color:aliceblue; color:blue; text-align:center">Announcement</h3>
    <p>At the Microsoft Build 2021 developer conference, CEO and chairman Satya Nadella teased about the existence of the next generation 
        of Windows during his keynote speech. According to Nadella, he had been self-hosting it for several months. He also teased that 
        an official announcement would come very soon.[25] Just a week after Nadella's keynote, Microsoft started sending invitations 
        for a dedicated Windows media event at 11 am ET on June 24, 2021.[26][27] Microsoft also posted an 11-minute video of Windows 
        start-up sounds to YouTube on June 10, 2021, with many people speculating both the time of the Microsoft event and the duration 
        of the Windows start-up sound video to be a reference to the name of the operating system as Windows 11.
    </p>
    <p>
        On June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was officially announced at a virtual event hosted by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay.
        According to Nadella, Windows 11 is "a re-imagining of the operating system".[33] Further details for developers such as updates 
        to the Microsoft Store, the new Windows App SDK (code-named "Project Reunion"), new Fluent Design guidelines, and more were 
        discussed during another developer-focused event on the same day.
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size:45px; background-color:aliceblue; color:blue; text-align:center">Release</h3>
    <p>
        The Windows 11 name was accidentally released in an official Microsoft support document in June 2021.[37][38] Leaked images of 
        a purported beta build of Windows 11's desktop surfaced online later on June 15, 2021,[39][40] which were followed by a leak of 
        the aforementioned build on the same day.[41] The screenshots and leaked build show an interface resembling that of the cancelled 
        Windows 10X, alongside a redesigned out-of-box experience (OOBE) and Windows 11 branding.[42] Microsoft would later confirm the 
        authenticity of the leaked beta, with Panay stating that it was an "early weird build".
    </p>

    <p>
        At the June 24 media event, Microsoft also announced that Windows 11 would be released in "Holiday 2021", with an exact date not 
        given.[45][46] Its release will be accompanied by a free upgrade for compatible Windows 10 devices through Windows Update.[47] On 
        June 28, Microsoft announced the release of the first preview build and SDK of Windows 11 to Windows Insiders.
    </p>

    <p>
        On August 31, 2021, Microsoft announced that Windows 11 was to be released on October 5, 2021.[49] The release would be phased, 
        with newer eligible devices to be offered the upgrade first.[6] Since its predecessor Windows 10 was released on July 29, 2015, 
        more than six years earlier, this is the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows operating systems, 
        beating the time between Windows XP (released on October 25, 2001) and Windows Vista (released on January 30, 2007).
    </p>

    <p>
        Microsoft officially released Windows 11 on October 4, 2021, at 2:00 p.m. PT, which was October 5 in parts of the world. 
        Updates through Windows Update are a phased rollout: Microsoft stated that they "expect all eligible Windows 10 devices to be 
        offered the upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022."
